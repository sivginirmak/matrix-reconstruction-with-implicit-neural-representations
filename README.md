- `data/` - Research data (max 2GB per file, use Git LFS for larger)
- `.github/workflows/` - Automated workflows including Claude AI assistant
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI research assistant instructions

## Getting Started

1. Start by documenting your assumption and hypothesis in `hypothesis.jsonl`
2. Add papers to `paper.jsonl` and conduct literature review in `related_work/`
3. Propose experiments in `proposal.jsonl`
4. Execute experiments and track in `run.jsonl`
5. Analyze results in `analysis.jsonl`
6. Draft your paper in `paper_drafts/`

## Research Methodology

This project follows standard scientific research methodology. See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed guidance.
