# Research Concept & Direction

## Research Question

This research explores the application of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to the fundamental problem of 2D matrix reconstruction and fitting. INRs have shown remarkable success in representing continuous signals and complex spatial data, but their potential for matrix completion and reconstruction tasks remains underexplored.

The project aims to develop novel neural architectures that can learn continuous representations of matrices using only partial observations, leveraging the inherent structure and patterns within the data. By representing matrices as continuous functions through INRs, we hypothesize that we can achieve more efficient and accurate reconstruction compared to traditional discrete approaches.

A key focus will be on understanding how INRs capture and interpolate matrix patterns, particularly in scenarios with missing or corrupted data. The research will investigate various neural architectures, positional encodings, and training strategies specifically optimized for matrix reconstruction tasks.
