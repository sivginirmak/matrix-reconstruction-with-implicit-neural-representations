# Experiment Ideas

## Research Focus

**Primary Hypothesis:** Planar factorization methods (K-Planes) will demonstrate superior reconstruction quality compared to traditional MLP-based approaches (NeRF) for 2D matrix reconstruction, due to their explicit geometric bias toward planar structures inherent in 2D data.

**Research Question:** How do different INR architectures originally designed for 3D radiance fields perform when repurposed for 2D matrix reconstruction, and what architectural components drive superior performance in the 2D domain?

## Core Experiments

### Experiment 1: Architectural Comparison - K-Planes vs NeRF vs Gaussian Methods

**Research Hypothesis:** K-Planes architecture will outperform NeRF and Gaussian-based methods for 2D matrix reconstruction due to explicit planar factorization.

* **Objective:** Test the core hypothesis that planar factorization methods achieve superior reconstruction quality for 2D matrices
* **Independent Variables:**

  * Matrix resolution (64x64, 128x128, 256x256)
  * Sparsity level (10%, 25%, 50%, 75% missing data)
* **Dependent Variables:**
  * Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) \[Target: >35dB]
  * Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) \[Target: >0.95]
  * Parameter count and memory usage
  * Training convergence time
* **Method:**
  1. Generate synthetic 2D matrices from known continuous functions (sinusoids, Gaussians, polynomial surfaces)
  2. Create sparse observations with controlled missing data patterns
  3. Train each architecture with identical hyperparameters and training protocols
  4. Evaluate reconstruction quality using standardized metrics
  5. Statistical significance testing across 10 random seeds per condition
* **Success Criteria:** K-Planes achieves >5dB PSNR improvement over NeRF baseline with statistical significance (p<0.05)
* **Validity Threats:** Architecture implementation differences, hyperparameter sensitivity
* **Mitigations:** Use reference implementations, extensive hyperparameter search, multiple random initializations

### Experiment 2: Decoder Architecture Analysis - Linear vs Nonlinear Decoders

**Research Hypothesis:** Linear decoders with appropriate factorization achieve comparable performance to nonlinear MLPs with better interpretability and efficiency.

* **Objective:** Challenge the assumption that nonlinear MLP decoders are essential for expressive neural fields

### Experiment 3: Positional Encoding Comparison for 2D Domain

**Research Hypothesis:** 2D-specific encoding strategies are more effective than high-dimensional adaptations from 3D methods.

* **Objective:** Test the assumption that positional encoding strategies optimal for 3D scenes transfer directly to 2D domains
* **Independent Variables:**
  * Encoding type (Fourier features, SIREN, K-Planes native, learned embeddings)
  * Frequency range and sampling (low, medium, high frequency emphasis)
  * Encoding dimension (32, 64, 128)
* **Dependent Variables:**
  * Convergence speed (epochs to target PSNR)
  * Final reconstruction quality
  * Spectral bias (frequency response analysis)
* **Method:**
  1. Implement each encoding scheme within identical architecture
  2. Test on matrices with varying frequency content
  3. Analyze spectral properties of reconstructions
  4. Measure convergence dynamics
* **Success Criteria:** 2D-optimized encodings achieve >20% faster convergence with equivalent final quality

### Experiment 4: Robustness Analysis - Missing Data Patterns and Noise

**Research Hypothesis:** K-Planes architecture demonstrates superior robustness to structured missing data patterns due to planar interpolation.

* **Objective:** Assess architectural robustness to real-world data corruption scenarios
* **Independent Variables:**
  * Missing data pattern (random, block-wise, stripe patterns, edge corruption)
  * Noise level (σ ∈ \[0, 0.1, 0.05, 0.1] Gaussian noise)
  * Matrix content type (smooth, textured, high-frequency)
* **Dependent Variables:**
  * Reconstruction quality under corruption
  * Graceful degradation curves
  * Uncertainty quantification accuracy
* **Method:**
  1. Create systematic corruption scenarios
  2. Test each architecture's robustness
  3. Analyze failure modes and recovery patterns
  4. Compare interpolation quality in missing regions
* **Success Criteria:** K-Planes maintains >30dB PSNR under 50% structured missing data vs <25dB for baselines
