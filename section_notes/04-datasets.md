# Datasets for 2D Matrix Reconstruction Research

## Research Framework

**Research Question**: How do different INR architectures originally designed for 3D radiance fields perform when repurposed for 2D matrix reconstruction, and what architectural components drive superior performance in the 2D domain?

**Primary Hypothesis**: K-Planes will demonstrate superior reconstruction quality compared to traditional MLP-based approaches (NeRF) for 2D matrix reconstruction, due to their explicit geometric bias toward planar structures inherent in 2D data.

**Target Metrics**: >35dB PSNR, >2x parameter efficiency improvement, >30% training time reduction

**Research Vectoring**: The biggest risk dimension is whether architectural differences will be significant enough to detect in the "simpler" 2D domain compared to 3D scenes.

## Dataset Selection Strategy

### Research-Driven Dataset Categories

Our dataset selection follows a systematic approach to validate the core hypothesis across multiple dimensions:

1. **Complexity Gradient**: From simple geometric patterns (MNIST) to complex natural scenes (BSD100)
2. **Frequency Content**: Low-frequency smooth regions (CelebA faces) to high-frequency textures (DTD)
3. **Structural Bias**: Datasets that favor planar representations (CIFAR) vs. those requiring complex modeling
4. **Scale Diversity**: Multiple resolutions to test architectural scalability
5. **Domain Specificity**: General objects, faces, textures, and synthetic patterns

### Experimental Design Rationale

Each dataset serves a specific role in testing our central hypothesis:
- **Baseline Performance**: MNIST, CIFAR-10 establish fundamental reconstruction capabilities
- **Architectural Stress-Testing**: High-resolution datasets (BSD100, CelebA) reveal efficiency differences
- **Controlled Analysis**: Synthetic datasets isolate specific architectural components
- **Real-World Validation**: Natural image datasets provide practical performance metrics
