# Literature Review: Implicit Neural Representations for Matrix Reconstruction

## Overview

This literature review examines the intersection of **Implicit Neural Representations (INRs)** and **matrix reconstruction/completion**, focusing on adapting 3D INR methods (NeRF, K-Planes, TensoRF, Gaussian Splatting) to 2D matrix problems. We systematically analyze foundational INR work, tensor factorization methods, traditional matrix completion approaches, and recent reconstruction applications to identify research gaps and opportunities.

**Research Focus:** Comparing 2D fitting performances of (normally 3D) INRs such as K-Planes, GA-Planes, NeRF etc. Since everything is based on 2D reconstruction, any open-source image dataset can be used & the approach is CPU-friendly.

## CORE REFERENCE PAPER

**Kim & Fridovich-Keil (2025)** - "Grids Often Outperform Implicit Neural Representations" provides **direct validation** of our research hypothesis. Their systematic comparison across 2D and 3D reconstruction tasks demonstrates that:

* **Simple regularized grids** with interpolation train faster and achieve higher quality than INRs for most signals
* **INRs maintain advantage** only for signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure (e.g., shape contours)
* **Performance boundaries** are clearly defined, providing practical guidance for method selection

**Direct Relevance:** This is the closest prior work to our matrix reconstruction focus, validating that explicit grid methods can outperform implicit approaches in many scenarios.

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Foundational INR Methods

#### 1.1 Positional Encoding Breakthroughs

**Tancik et al. (NeurIPS 2020)** established that standard MLPs suffer from **spectral bias** - inability to learn high-frequency functions in low-dimensional domains. Their **Fourier feature mapping** γ(v) \= \[cos(2πBv), sin(2πBv)]^T enables MLPs to overcome this limitation by transforming the Neural Tangent Kernel into a stationary kernel with tunable bandwidth.

**Sitzmann et al. (NeurIPS 2020)** proposed **SIREN** networks using sine activation functions sin(ω₀ · Wx + b), providing an alternative that enables access to all derivatives and smooth signal representation without explicit positional encoding.

**Key Insight for Matrix Reconstruction:** Both approaches address the fundamental challenge of representing continuous functions from discrete coordinates, directly applicable to matrix completion where we want smooth interpolation between observed entries.

#### 1.2 Neural Radiance Fields Foundation

**Mildenhall et al. (ECCV 2020)** demonstrated how MLPs with positional encoding can represent complex 3D scenes as continuous 5D radiance fields, establishing the paradigm of coordinate-based neural representations.

**Müller et al. (SIGGRAPH 2022)** - **Best Technical Paper** - introduced **Instant-NGP** with multiresolution hash encoding, achieving orders of magnitude speedup while maintaining quality. This breakthrough encoding technique is relevant to all INR methods and demonstrates how architectural innovations can dramatically improve efficiency.

### 2. Explicit vs Implicit Representations

#### 2.1 Grid-Based Alternatives

**Yu et al. (CVPR 2022)** introduced **Plenoxels** - radiance fields without neural networks, using sparse 3D grids with spherical harmonics. They achieved **100x faster** optimization than NeRF with no quality loss, demonstrating that explicit representations can match neural quality.

**Kerbl et al. (SIGGRAPH 2023)** developed **3D Gaussian Splatting**, representing scenes with explicit 3D Gaussians and achieving **real-time rendering** (≥30 fps at 1080p). This revolutionary explicit approach provides an important comparison point for implicit methods.

#### 2.2 Hybrid Approaches

**Wang et al. (CVPR 2025)** proposed **MetricGrids**, combining multiple elementary metric grids in different spaces with high-order Taylor expansion terms. This bridges explicit and implicit methods, offering superior fitting accuracy through novel grid structures.

### 3. Tensor Factorization Methods for INRs

#### 3.1 TensoRF: Tensorial Decomposition

**Chen et al. (ECCV 2022)** revolutionized INR efficiency by modeling radiance fields as **4D tensors** and applying factorization:

* **CP Decomposition:** Factorizes tensors into rank-one components with compact vectors
* **Vector-Matrix (VM) Decomposition:** Novel factorization into vector and matrix factors
* **Performance:** 10-30 minute training vs. hours/days for NeRF, with <4-75MB models

**Direct Relevance to Matrix Problems:** TensoRF's tensor factorization techniques are immediately applicable to 2D matrix decomposition, providing efficient low-rank representations.

#### 3.2 K-Planes: Planar Factorization

**Fridovich-Keil et al. (CVPR 2023)** introduced elegant **planar factorization** using (d choose 2) planes for d-dimensional scenes:

* **4D Scenes:** 6 planes (3 spatial: xy,xz,yz + 3 spatio-temporal: xt,yt,zt)
* **Interpretability:** Static objects appear only in spatial planes, dynamic in spatio-temporal
* **Efficiency:** 1000x compression over full 4D grid

**Matrix Application:** For 2D matrices, this reduces to single plane representation, but the factorization principles and multi-scale approaches remain applicable.

### 4. Advanced INR Techniques

#### 4.1 Transfer Learning for INRs

**Vyas et al. (NeurIPS 2024)** introduced **STRAINER** - learning transferable features for INRs through shared encoder layers across multiple INRs with independent decoders. They achieved **≈+10dB** signal quality improvement, demonstrating that INR features can be made transferable and significantly accelerate convergence.

#### 4.2 Reconstruction Applications

**Shi et al. (TMLR 2024)** demonstrated **joint reconstruction** using INRs for multiple objects through Bayesian framework with latent variables. Common patterns assist individual reconstruction, showing superior performance with sparse observations.

### 5. Traditional Matrix Completion Foundations

#### 5.1 Nuclear Norm Minimization

**Candès & Recht (2009)** and **Recht (2011)** established theoretical foundations for matrix completion via **nuclear norm minimization**:

* **Problem:** Recover low-rank matrix from small fraction of entries
* **Method:** min ||X||\* subject to observed entries constraints
* **Guarantees:** Exact recovery under incoherence conditions with O(nr polylog(n)) samples

**Limitations for INR Context:**

1. **Discrete representation** - no interpolation between entries
2. **Storage requirements** - must explicitly store matrix dimensions
3. **Complex pattern capture** - struggles with non-linear relationships
4. **Fixed resolution** - cannot query non-integer coordinates

## Critical Analysis and Research Gaps

**Mip-NeRF Series (Barron et al., ICCV 2021, CVPR 2022)** introduced integrated positional encoding for multiscale representation, eliminating aliasing artifacts through cone tracing instead of point sampling. For matrix reconstruction, this suggests **continuous matrix interpolation methods** that handle different resolution queries smoothly.

#### Efficiency Breakthroughs

**EfficientNeRF (Hu et al., CVPR 2022)** achieved significant speedups through adaptive sampling and early ray termination. These **importance sampling strategies** are directly applicable to matrix reconstruction where full matrix evaluation may be prohibitive.

**FastNeRF (Garbin et al., ICCV 2021)** demonstrated 200 FPS rendering through factorized representations and caching strategies, showing how **separation of concerns** (position vs. view dependence) enables real-time performance.

#### Regularization and Sparse Reconstruction

**RegNeRF (Niemeyer et al., CVPR 2022)** provides the most directly relevant advances for sparse matrix completion:
- **Depth smoothness regularization** → matrix smoothness constraints
- **Normal consistency losses** → structural consistency in matrices  
- **Patch-based regularization** → local matrix structure preservation

**Technical Insight:** RegNeRF's success with sparse views directly translates to sparse matrix completion challenges.

#### Novel Geometric Representations

**PermutoNeRF (Rosu & Behnke, CVPR 2023)** introduced lattice-based representations using permutohedra, providing alternatives to standard grid structures. This suggests **structured coordinate systems** beyond Cartesian grids may benefit matrix reconstruction.

### Explicit vs Implicit: The Definitive Analysis

#### Direct Grid Optimization Advances

**Direct Voxel Grid Optimization (Sun et al., CVPR 2022)** provides crucial evidence:
- **100x speedup** over NeRF with comparable quality
- **Simple L2 loss** with spatial regularization sufficient
- **No neural networks required** for high-quality reconstruction

**Critical Implication:** For matrix reconstruction, direct parameter optimization may outperform neural approaches when explicit structure is appropriate.

#### Kim & Fridovich-Keil (2025): Decision Framework

Their systematic evaluation establishes **clear performance boundaries**:

**Grids Outperform INRs When:**
- Regular structure (natural images, textures)
- Speed is crucial
- Limited training data
- Interpretability required

**INRs Maintain Advantage When:**
- Underlying low-dimensional manifold structure
- Irregular sampling patterns
- Complex nonlinear relationships
- Multi-resolution requirements

**Matrix Reconstruction Decision Tree:**
```
Matrix Structure Assessment:
├─ Regular grid structure → Use explicit grids
├─ Irregular/sparse patterns → Use INRs  
├─ Mixed characteristics → Use hybrid approaches
└─ Unknown structure → Start with grids, adapt if needed
```

### Modern Matrix Completion Theory Integration

#### Nonlinear Matrix Completion Bridge

**Ongie et al. (SIAM J. MDS 2019)** showed how tensor lifting enables nonlinear matrix completion. **INRs perform implicit lifting** through hidden layers, naturally handling nonlinear relationships without manual feature engineering.

**Technical Connection:** INR coordinate encoding ≈ tensor lifting to higher-dimensional space where relationships become more linear.

#### Neural-Tensor Factorization Unification

**Factor Fields (Chen et al., 2023)** provides the theoretical bridge:
