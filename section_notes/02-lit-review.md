# Literature Review

## Initial Literature Notes

Recent work on INRs has demonstrated their effectiveness in representing complex signals like images, 3D shapes, and audio. Studies by Tancik et al. (2020) and Sitzmann et al. (2020) have established fundamental principles for frequency encoding and periodic activation functions in INRs, though primarily focusing on spatial and temporal signals.

Traditional matrix completion methods, including nuclear norm minimization and collaborative filtering, provide important baselines. However, these approaches often struggle with capturing complex patterns and typically require storing the full matrix dimensions explicitly.
