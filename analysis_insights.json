  "methods": "Statistical analysis of PSNR performance, parameter efficiency, and compression ratios across K-Planes, GA-Planes, and NeRF architectures",
  "findings": [
    "K-Planes (multiply, nonconvex) achieves highest parameter efficiency: 1.708 dB/K params",
    "K-Planes architectures consistently provide 16-23x compression ratio vs full matrix storage",
    "Multiplicative feature combination provides 7.36 dB improvement over additive",
    "Nonconvex decoders provide 6.04 dB improvement over linear decoders",
    "GA-Planes provide marginal PSNR improvement (+0.24 dB) at 3x parameter cost"
  ],
  "implications": [
    "Explicit geometric factorization (K-Planes) fundamentally superior to implicit encoding (NeRF)",
    "Parameter efficiency more important than absolute parameter count for INR performance",
    "Multiplicative feature interactions critical for capturing 2D structure",
    "Architectural inductive bias can overcome universal approximation limitations"
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "Results limited to single natural image (astronaut)",
    "No comparison with modern NeRF variants (InstantNGP, TensoRF)",
    "Fixed training regime may bias toward certain architectures",
    "2D results may not generalize to 3D volumetric reconstruction"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Multi-dataset validation (BSD100, CIFAR-10, synthetic patterns)",
    "Modern baseline comparisons (InstantNGP, TensoRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting)",
    "Theoretical analysis of K-Planes approximation bounds",
    "Extension to 3D volumetric reconstruction tasks"
