## Theoretical Analysis

### When Grids Excel
1. **High observation density** - sufficient samples for grid interpolation
2. **Uniform signal structure** - consistent patterns across spatial regions  
3. **Fast inference requirements** - lookup is faster than neural evaluation
4. **Limited computational resources** - simpler optimization and storage

### When INRs Excel  
1. **Sparse observations** - neural interpolation handles gaps better
2. **Complex signal patterns** - non-linear modeling captures structure
3. **Lower-dimensional manifolds** - signals with underlying structure  
4. **Continuous querying** - arbitrary coordinate evaluation needed

**Challenges:**  
- **Fixed resolution** - difficult to query non-integer coordinates

### INR Methods for Matrix Completion

**Advantages:**

2. **Matrix-specific evaluation** on reconstruction tasks  
3. **Identify boundary conditions** where each method excels
4. **Practical guidance** for method selection based on matrix characteristics

### Implementation Priorities
1. **Grid baseline** - implement regularized grid interpolation first
2. **INR variants** - K-Planes, NeRF, SIREN for systematic comparison
3. **Hybrid approaches** - combine grid initialization with neural refinement  
4. **Efficiency analysis** - training time, inference speed, memory usage

### Expected Outcomes
- **Validation of grid superiority** for dense, uniform matrices
