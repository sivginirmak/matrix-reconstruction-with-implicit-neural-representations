IMPORTANT: Copy Visualization Assets

The paper includes references to visualization assets that need to be copied manually:

1. Copy ALL PNG files from:
   experiments/exp001_architecture_comparison/full_results/visualizations/

2. To the paper figures directory:
   paper_drafts/figures/

3. The paper currently references:
   - figures/architecture_comparison.png (placeholder created)

4. Additional figures that could be included:
   - K-planesmultiply_nonconvex_seed0.png (best K-Planes result)
   - NeRFsiren_siren_seed0.png (best NeRF result) 
   - GA-Planesmultiply+plane_nonconvex_seed0.png (GA-Planes result)

Commands to run:
```bash
cp experiments/exp001_architecture_comparison/full_results/visualizations/*.png paper_drafts/figures/
```

This will ensure the visualizations referenced in the paper are available for compilation and display the actual experimental results comparing architecture quality.
